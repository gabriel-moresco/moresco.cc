Hi, I'm Gabriel Moresco, a software engineer from Brazil. I'm currently CTO at Advents, the first mobile attribution tool in Brazil.

I'm graduated in Mechanical Engineering on Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFC), but I fell in love with coding and entrepreneurship and since then I've never let go.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or collaborate on something. You can find me on any of the social media platforms listed above.
