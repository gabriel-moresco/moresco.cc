summary: Introducing Advents, my new startup that aims to solve the problem of attribution tools for mobile apps in Brazil.
---

During my two years at Favorito, I was responsible for managing marketing campaigns for Android and iOS app installs. For this, it's essential to use a tool that measures the performance of each campaign, providing clarity on which channels are bringing in users, how they behave within the app, and what return they are generating for the company. This way, I could make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing actions.

This is where the problem arises... Currently, there are about 10 companies in the world that develop these tools, and none of them are Brazilian. After testing several and practically having to beg to be able to hire them, I identified the following problems:

1. **Focus on large companies**: Current solutions are aimed at the enterprise market. If you're a small or medium-sized business, you'll be left unassisted when it comes to hiring and using the tool. You might think: "But can't I just access the website and start using it without needing help to hire?" The answer is NO. You need to contact the sales team to get a quote and only then can you hire the solution.

2. **Support only in English**: Unless you're a large company, the support offered is exclusively in English.

3. **Billing in dollars**: In addition to English support, the only currency accepted for payment is the dollar.

4. **Annual plans**: If, by chance, you manage to schedule a meeting with the sales team (probably in English), the only hiring option will be an annual plan with upfront payment (goodbye cash flow).

After experiencing these problems firsthand over the last two years, I decided to focus all my energy on solving them.

Thus, **[Advents](https://advents.io)** is born, the first attribution tool for mobile apps aimed at the Brazilian market and small and medium-sized businesses.
